# workingOntheBlog---without-swagger
 this is a blog assigment( but only have swagger instaled-not working )

HI!ðŸ’¦

I've made this blog app, and It could be more original, but there was no time left. Also, my apologies for the swagger that is not working, and the mocha and chai tests too. After crashing the app, it was clear that I won't make it on time. ( It happened on the building too! ). If I had just time for building this app It would be different, but the reality is that my job and life can't be put aside for ten days coding challenge. The truth is that I need more learning to make it even better! 

*To run this app, download and extract the files. Run the app from VS Code and terminal on localhost 5000
*If you want to see the Admin page and log in to create, edit or delete posts go to localhost 5000/Admin

This app is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. All the credits go to The Net Ninja:

Also, there were a lot of other videos, but I used that course the most.

Best Regards!ðŸ’™
